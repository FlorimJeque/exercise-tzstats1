## Running end-to-end tests

Even e2e tests, i didn't managed to add test feature, since i'm really new to Test at frontend. I would like to evolve in this feature.

## Notes

To be honest, i'm really new to many things you asked, such as state management, frontend tests. I would love to learn with you guys, i really enjoyed the exercise, i learned nice things with it. I didn't managed to complete all tasks correctly, but i'm sure with more time i can.
